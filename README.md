Flutter Firebase Authentication App.

## Overview

This Flutter app exemplifies a robust authentication system using Firebase Auth and Firestore. The app encompasses four key screens:

1. **Welcome Screen:** Intelligently checks whether the user's email already exists. If so, it seamlessly redirects to the Login Screen; otherwise, it guides the user to the Signup Screen.
2. **Login Screen:** Ensures secure user authentication through Firebase.
3. **Signup Screen:** Facilitates the creation of new accounts using Firebase authentication.
4. **User Profile Screen:** Presents user details fetched from Firestore.

Explore the codebase to observe the efficient integration of Flutter with Firebase for user authentication and data storage. Your insights and feedback are highly appreciated!
